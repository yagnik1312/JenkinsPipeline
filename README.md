## Pipeline Scripts

The `pipelineScripts.groovy` script contains common functions used in both pipelines. Here are the functions:

- **buildDockerImage**: Builds a Docker image.
- **pushDockerImage**: Pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub.
- **pullDockerImage**: Pulls a Docker image from Docker Hub.
- **createNetwork**: Tries to create a Docker network if it does not already exist.
- **runDockerContainer**: Runs a Docker container.

# Note : name of pipe line script should be "pipelineScripts".
